# ðŸ”§ Avoiding Migration Errors - Complete Guide

## The Problem

When you clone the repository, you're encountering migration errors because there are **duplicate migration files** with the same numbers:
- Two `0004_*.py` files
- Two `0005_*.py` files  
- Two `0006_*.py` files

This happens when multiple developers create migrations at the same time or when branches are merged.

## The Solution - Three Easy Options

### âœ… Option 1: Automated Setup (RECOMMENDED)

**Windows:**
```bash
# Just double-click this file:
setup.bat

# Or run in terminal:
.venv\Scripts\activate
python setup.py
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python setup.py
```

This will automatically:
- Install dependencies
- Remove duplicate migrations
- Run migrations
- Set up the database

### âœ… Option 2: Quick Cleanup

If you already have the project set up but getting migration errors:

```bash
# Run cleanup script
python cleanup_migrations.py

# Then migrate
python manage.py migrate
```

### âœ… Option 3: Fresh Start (Nuclear Option)

If everything is broken:

```bash
# 1. Delete database
del db.sqlite3   # Windows
rm db.sqlite3    # Mac/Linux

# 2. Clean migrations
python cleanup_migrations.py

# 3. Migrate fresh
python manage.py migrate

# 4. Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## What I've Created for You

I've just created **4 helpful files** in your repository:

### 1. `setup.py` 
Automated Python setup script that:
- Checks for virtual environment
- Installs dependencies
- Removes duplicate migrations automatically
- Runs migrations
- Guides you through superuser creation

### 2. `setup.bat` (Windows only)
Double-click to run! Does everything for you:
- Creates virtual environment
- Installs packages
- Cleans migrations
- Sets up database

### 3. `cleanup_migrations.py`
Specifically removes the problematic duplicate migration files:
- `0004_alter_purchaseorderitem_unit_price.py`
- `0005_sync_purchase_order_model.py`
- `0006_fix_purchase_order_created_at.py`

### 4. `QUICK_SETUP.md`
Complete documentation with:
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Common error solutions
- Environment configuration
- Troubleshooting guide

## For Future Clones

When you or someone else clones the repository:

**Windows Users:**
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd GROUP-5-ERP
setup.bat
```

**Mac/Linux Users:**
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd GROUP-5-ERP
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python setup.py
```

That's it! No more migration errors.

## Why This Happens & How to Prevent It

### Why Duplicate Migrations Occur:
1. Multiple developers work on different branches
2. Both create migrations at the same time
3. Both get numbered the same (0004, 0005, etc.)
4. When branches merge, you have duplicates

### Prevention:
1. **Before creating migrations**, pull latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **After creating migrations**, push immediately:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   git add erpdb/migrations/
   git commit -m "Add migrations"
   git push
   ```

3. **If conflicts occur**, run cleanup script:
   ```bash
   python cleanup_migrations.py
   ```

## Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Fresh clone | `python setup.py` |
| Migration errors | `python cleanup_migrations.py` |
| Database corrupted | Delete `db.sqlite3` and migrate |
| Missing packages | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Can't create migrations | Check for duplicate files |

## Testing Your Setup

After setup, verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Start server
python manage.py runserver

# 2. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000

# 3. Check these URLs work:
#    - /admin/
#    - /erp/dashboard/
#    - /erp/products/
#    - /erp/vendors/
```

## Need Help?

1. âœ… Read `QUICK_SETUP.md`
2. âœ… Run `python cleanup_migrations.py`
3. âœ… Delete database and start fresh
